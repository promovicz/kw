'''Right''', a.k.a. '''dex''', is a function that returns its rightmost argument. When it has only one argument, it could be referred to as '''self''' or the '''identity function'''.
In some dialects the identity function could serve as a placeholder for missing indices in square-bracket indexing or for missing arguments in [[projection]]s.
