'''Deep Amend''', also known as '''dmend''' or '''drill''' is a deep version of [[Amend]] which allows modification of elements which are nested deep inside an array.

Deep Amend takes 3 or 4 arguments, where:
* <code>x</code> is an array to amend
* <code>y</code> is the index route to amend
* <code>z</code> is the function to apply to those indices
* <code>u</code> (optional), is the second argument to <code>z</code>

It is very similar to [[Amend]] in its functionality. The main difference is that <code>y</code> when given an array indexes into subarrays when used.

ngn/k's amend has <code>z</code> as the optional argument, instead of having <code>f</code> as an optional argument.
