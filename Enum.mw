{{primitive|!i}}

'''enum''', a.k.a. '''til'''<ref>https://code.kx.com/q/ref/til/</ref>, '''range''' (from Python), '''iota''' (from APL), generates a list of integers [[between]] 0 and a given integer <code>x</code>.
  !5
 0 1 2 3 4
Dialects based on k6 support negative integers - the generated range in that case is [[between]] <code>x</code> and 0:
  !-5
 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
[[Odometer]] is an extension of enum for int lists.
