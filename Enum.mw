'''Enum''', a.k.a. '''til''' (k4), '''range''' (from Python?), '''iota''' (from APL), generates a list of integers from 0 to a given integer <tt>x</tt> (left-inclusive right-exclusive).
  !5
 0 1 2 3 4
Dialects based on k6 support negative integers - the generated range in that case is from <tt>x</tt> to 0 (again left-inclusive right-exclusive):
  !-5
 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
