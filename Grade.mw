{{primitive|&lt;x<br>&gt;x}}

'''grade''' returns the [[domain]] of a collection (list, table, or dictionary) sorted by its [[range]]. It has two versions: '''up''' (<code>&lt;x</code>) and '''down''' (<code>&gt;x</code>), a.k.a. '''asc''' and '''desc''' by analogy with SQL.

Grade uses a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stable_sorts stable] sorting algorithm - [[match|equivalent]] items are sorted in their original order.

Sorting (as in sorting the range by itself) can be implemented through the idiom <code>x@&lt;x</code> or <code>x@&gt;x</code>. K7 and k9 support an additional dedicated sort-ascending primitive: [[sort|<code>^x</code>]].
