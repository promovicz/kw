{{primitive|x!y}}
The '''mod''', '''modulo''', '''remainder''' or '''residue'''<ref>https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Residue</ref> function, denoted by <code>!</code>, is used for modulo in K.

Up until the K4 dialect, the modulo operator was [[Atomicity|left atomic]] on account of the [[rotate]] overload. 

From K5 onward, the modulo primitive is [[Atomicity|right atomic.]]<ref>[https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/58587397#58587397 JohnEarnest on the order of arguments for mod in K]</ref>
