== Patterns ==

=== Sum ===
<code>+/</code>

'''Description:''' function to sum an array. Can be used with initial value.

'''Examples'''
<code>+/1 2 3 4 5 -> 15</code>
<code>+/(1 2;2 3) -> 3 5</code>

'''Dialects''': all

'''Primitives''': [[plus]], [[over]]

=== Deltas ===
<code>-':</code>

'''Description:''' Function to find the differences between members of an array. Comes in various flavors.

'''Examples'''
<code>-':1 2 3 4 -> 1 1 1 1  /the builtin eachp prepends an array with zero before evaluation, so the output is the same size</code>
<code>-':5 2 4 8 -> 5 -3 2 4</code>
<code>{y/(1_;-1_)@\:x}[6 7 8;-] -> 1 1  /you can substitute the default eachp with your own for different behaviour, like this shakti example that just evaluates over each pair in x without prepending 0</code>
<code>/the difference is highlighted here:
-':6 7 8 -> 6 1 1</code>

'''Dialects''': all, syntax may vary

'''Primitives''': [[eachp]], [[minus]]
