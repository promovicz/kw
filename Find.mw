{{primitive|x?y}}

The '''find''' primitive is used to find the index of an atom <code>y</code> in array <code>x</code>. It returns <code>0N</code> if the element is not found.

Find is [[atomicity|right atomic]].

<pre>
 "XYZ"?"XYXZB"
0 1 0 2 0N
 5 8 5?56 8 1 5
0N 1 0N 0
</pre>
For dictionaries, returns the keys associated with the given values:
<pre>
 (`a`b`c`d!23 14 9 5)?9 14
`c`b
</pre>

== K3 ==

In K3, Find is [[atomicity|non-atomic.]] It considers <code>y</code> as a single unit, and will return a single index for it. <code>?/:</code> is needed to simulate the functionality of later Ks.
