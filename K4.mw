K4 is the major dialect behind the primary implementation provided by [[KX Systems]]<ref>https://kx.com</ref>. The K4 spec is generally paired with kdb+, and Q, its accompanying query language.


== History ==

== Changes from K3 ==

Many changes can be seen from K3 to K4.

'''Primitive changes:'''
* % from reciprocal to square root
* ^ from shape/power to except/fill
* monadic @ from atom? to type

The system values (prefixed with an underscore) from K3 are no longer present in K4, which uses predefined names for system functions. Some other functions are prefixed with a <code>.</code>.
