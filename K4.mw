'''K4''' is the major dialect behind the primary implementation provided by [[KX Systems]] <ref>https://kx.com</ref>. K4 is usually bundled with its accompanying query language [[Q]] to form the data processing product [[kdb+]].

== Documentation ==

Documentation for K4 is available online at KX Systems. <ref>https://code.kx.com/home/</ref>

== History ==
K4 is the longest surviving dialect of K due to 20 years of support by KX systems.

In 2018<ref>https://www.anaconda.com/blog/anaconda-and-kx-systems-partner-to-deliver-kdb-database-system-and-related-machine-learning-libraries</ref>, KX Systems released Fusion<ref>https://code.kx.com/q/interfaces/fusion/</ref>, an open source language integration project that was added alongside their existing IPC and C/C++ interfaces. 

== Changes from K3 ==

Many changes can be seen from K3 to K4.

'''Primitive changes:'''
* % from reciprocal to square root
* ^ from shape/power to except/fill
* monadic @ from atom? to type

The system values (prefixed with an underscore) from K3 are no longer present in K4, which uses predefined names for system functions. Some other functions are prefixed with a <code>.</code>.
