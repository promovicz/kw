{{primitive|,x}}

'''Enlist''' is a primitive that returns the list of its arguments. It is most often used in its monadic form: <code>,x</code> (sometimes called '''singleton'''). All K dialects support n-adic enlist through the list literal syntax: <code>(x;y;z</code>..<code>)</code>

K4 allows lists literals with missing items to act as [[projection]]s, e.g. <code>(;)</code> is the dyadic form equivalent to <code>{(x;y)}</code>.
