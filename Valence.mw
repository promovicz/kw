'''Valence''', a.k.a. '''arity''' or '''adicity''', is the number of arguments a function accepts.

The minimum valence of a k function is 1 and the maximum is 8.

Applying a function to fewer arguments creates a [[projection]]. Applying it to more arguments usually causes a rank error, though some primitives may support more arguments than their nominal valence.

The following Greek and Latin-based English words are commonly used to describe a function of a particular valence<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity#Terminology</ref>:
