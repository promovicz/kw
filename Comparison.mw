{{primitive|x&lt;y<br>x&gt;y<br>x&#61;y}}

The comparison primitives in K are <code><</code>, <code>></code> and <code>=</code> which stand for lesser than, greater than and equal to respectively.

character comparison is done via ASCII codes/UTF-8 code points, based on the implementation.

The comparison functions always give a boolean value, 1 or 0.

<pre>

 "abc" > "!c "
1 0 1
