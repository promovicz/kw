{{primitive|x&lt;y<br>x&gt;y<br>x&#61;y}}

The comparison primitives in K are <code><</code>, <code>></code> and <code>=</code> which stand for lesser than, greater than and equal to respectively. Comparisons are [[atomicity|fully atomic]].

Characters are compared as bytes, except in oK which supports Unicode and compares characters by their code points.

The comparison functions always give a boolean value, 1 or 0.
