'''oK''' (open K) is an open source implementation of the K5 (and later K6) dialect created by [[John Earnest]]. The main aim of oK is to be an easily accessible environment to learn and understand the fundamentals of K. oK was hence written as a learning oriented toy language with code simplicity in mind, and is not very suitable for use in bigger projects.

== History ==

oK was released in January 2015. It was one of the first open source K implementations alongside [[Kona]] (K3), which was released in 2014.

In early 2015, work had begun on the oK docs.

On 4th August 2015, interactive K environment (iKe) was introduced to oK. Alongside the existing interpreter, iKe was originally intended to be a [https://processing.org/ Processing]-like 2D drawing and animation tool.

On 16th October 2016, the initial prototype for the oK mobile UI was added.

== Learning Resources ==
oK has comprehensive documentation on its primitives and syntax, which is now situated in its [https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok/blob/gh-pages/docs/Manual.md manual].

The oK repository also contains resources and learning materials for programming in K, a general rarity in K implementations. 

The <code>docs</code> folder in the repository contains articles on programming in K, Trees, and the manual.

The <code>examples</code> folder in the repository contains many examples of simple programs in oK, some with line-by-line explanations.

== Running ==
The main method of running ok is via the [https://johnearnest.github.io/ok/ online repl].

<code>oK.js</code> can be used in HTML+JS websites as a tool to enhance the expressiveness of your code.

Another way to use oK is with the help of node.js. <code>node repl.js</code> will open a REPL in the terminal, similar to the browser based REPL.

oK has a <code>package.json</code> file for the npm registry, but it is not available from npm.

== Interactive K Environment ==

iKe is a toy frontend for oK which allows users to create graphical, event driven programs in K. Some notable features are:
* mouse and keyboard support
* iKe gists
* gif recording functionality
* Sound support
* builtin color palettes and bitmaps
* AJAX HTTP requests
* image and vector imports

iKe is not built as an embeddable tool, but there are ways to use its source to draw on the HTML canvas using K.

== oK Mobile ==

oK Mobile is a mobile-oriented interface for oK which allows display of graphs and plotting. oK mobile comes with an in-site keyboard which has convenient symbols and digraphs for quick use in the oK REPL.
