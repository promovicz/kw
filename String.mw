{{primitive|$x}}The '''string''' function, generally denoted by <code>$</code>, converts atoms to their string equivalents.

<code>$</code> on a character is the equivalent of [[enlist|enlisting]] it.

The string primitive is [[Atomicity|right atomic]], except that in kona, oK, k7, and k9 character lists are treated as if they are atoms.
