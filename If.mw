'''If''' or '''cond''' is the main form of conditional evaluation in K.

If is special, because its arguments are evaluated based on the value of the conditions given. Multiple conditions can be given.<ref>https://code.kx.com/q/style/conditionals/</ref>

The return value of multi argument <code>$</code> is the one which is after the first condition satisfied. If none of the conditions are satisfied, the last argument is returned.
