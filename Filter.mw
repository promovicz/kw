'''Filter''' and '''filter-out''' are used to filter elements from an array using a monadic(single-argument) function <code>f</code>.

For '''filter'''(<code>#</code>), the elements which return truthy values when passed through <code>f</code> are left in the array. For '''filter-out'''(<code>_</code>), the elements returning falsy values are kept.

Note that filters are verbs and hence cannot take a primitive as argument. <code>f</code> must be a defined function or a train.
