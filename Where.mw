'''Where''' replicates each item in the domain as many times as the corresponding value (usually required to be a non-negative integer) in the range:
  &1 0 1 4 2
 0 2 3 3 3 3 4 4
For a boolean list it returns the positions of the truthy items:
  &0 0 1 1 0 1
 2 3 5
For a single integer it generates that many zeroes:
  &3
 0 0 0
For a dictionary it uses the keys instead of indices:
  &`a`b!2 3
 `a`a`b`b`b

A non-standard extension in ngn/k works on matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. It returns the paths to truthy atoms as the columns of a matrix:
  &(0 1 0;1 0 0;1 1 1)
 (0 1 2 2 2
  1 0 0 1 2)
