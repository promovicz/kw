'''ngn/k''' is an implementation of K6 created by [[ngn]]. It has been rewritten more than once, and has undergone many changes from its original iteration, borrowing ideas from many [[Arthur Whitney]] Ks, and occasionally deviating from their functionality.

ngn/k is written in [[Whitney-style C]], and is written to be performant, compact, and with minimal dependencies.

== History ==
Development on ngn/k was started on April 9, 2017<ref>https://github.com/ngn/k/commits/aff40c33f75eeab4c5f69fa55b795d83fbd6288a</ref>. The older Github repository for ngn/k points towards kparc.io<ref>https://kparc.com/k.txt</ref> for its spec.

The codebase was then moved to Gitlab. The exact date is not known since the repository no longer exists on the site.

The ngn/k repl and editor was created in October 2020 and subsequently moved from <code>ngn.bitbucket.io</code> to <code>ngn.bitbucket.io/k</code><ref>https://chat.stackexchange.com/search?q=ngn.bitbucket.io&Room=90748&page=10&pagesize=50&
sort=newest</ref>. It has remained in that state ever since.

The codebase was the moved to Sourcetree on December 21, 2020<ref>https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/90748?m=56558503#56558503</ref>.

The current version of ngn/k resides in Codeberg, and the move was officially announced on May 21, 2021<ref>https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/57843141#57843141</ref>. The codeberg repository has its initial commit at 2019, where it had support for x86_64 linux only.

== Running ==
The main way of running ngn/k is building it. This can be done reliably on Unix-like systems with the help of either <code>clang-12</code> or <code>gcc-10</code> C compilers, and the <code>make</code> utility. Build instructions can be found in the ngn/k README file.

ngn/k has a WASM distribution available online. These can be accessed from the "Run Online" links in the sidebar. The Codeberg page is restricted in some countries.

[[User:Traws|Traws]] has a fork of ngn/k on [https://github.com/traws0/ngnk-windows Github] which is made for compilation under cosmopolitan libc.
