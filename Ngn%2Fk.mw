'''ngn/k''' is an implementation of [[K6]] created by [[ngn]]. It has been rewritten more than once, and has undergone many changes from its original iteration, borrowing ideas from many [[Arthur Whitney]] Ks, and occasionally deviating from their functionality.

ngn/k is written in [[Arthur_Whitney#Programming_Style|Whitney-style C]], and is written to be performant, compact, and with minimal dependencies.

== History ==
Development on ngn/k was started on April 9, 2017<ref>https://github.com/ngn/k/commits/aff40c33f75eeab4c5f69fa55b795d83fbd6288a</ref>. The older Github repository for ngn/k points towards kparc.io<ref>https://kparc.com/k.txt</ref> for its spec.

The codebase was then moved to Gitlab. The exact date is not known since the repository no longer exists on the site.

The ngn/k repl and editor was created in October 2020 and subsequently moved from <code>ngn.bitbucket.io</code> to <code>ngn.bitbucket.io/k</code><ref>https://chat.stackexchange.com/search?q=ngn.bitbucket.io&Room=90748&page=10&pagesize=50&
sort=newest</ref>. It has remained in that state ever since.

The codebase was the moved to Sourcehut (sr.ht) on December 21, 2020<ref>https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/90748?m=56558503#56558503</ref>.

The current version of ngn/k resides in Codeberg, and the move was officially announced on May 21, 2021<ref>https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/57843141#57843141</ref>. The codeberg repository has its initial commit at 2019, where it had support for x86_64 linux only.

ngn/k was indefinitely frozen<ref>https://codeberg.org/ngn/k/commit/7e7420217f9df95273a8605e05d6335d66dd8f8a</ref> on May 24, 2022.

== Running ==
The main way of running ngn/k is building it. This can be done reliably on Unix-like systems with the help of either <code>clang-12</code> or <code>gcc-10</code> C compilers, and the <code>make</code> utility. Build instructions can be found in the ngn/k README file.

ngn/k has a WASM distribution available online. These can be accessed from the "Run Online" links in the sidebar. The Codeberg page is restricted in some countries.

[[User:Traws|Traws]] has a fork of ngn/k on [https://github.com/traws0/ngnk-windows Github] which is made for compilation under cosmopolitan libc.

== Features ==

=== I/O Verbs ===
ngn/k's I/O verbs are defined as per the [[K6]] standard. They are made up of a single digit, followed by a <code>:</code> symbol: <code>loc u: data</code> for output and <code>u: loc</code> for input.

A symbol, string or number can be given as <Code>loc</code>. Any number given must be a valid tie number (see: [[Tie(ngn/k)]]).

Every input verb is classified by <code>data</code>:
* <code>0:</code> takes lists of strings. (concatenates them with newlines)
* <Code>1:</code> takes a single string.

=== Reserved Symbols ===
ngn/k has reserved symbols used for providing access to features that are not important enough to be added as primitives, but still warrant a name for quick use. These symbols can be used like any other nouns.

The ngn/k help topic for adverbs is available at <code>\`</code> in the ngn/k repl.

=== Defined Verbs ===
ngn/k allows creation of new verbs that can be used infix, as part of its syntax. These must be defined as follows (using <code>∇</code> as an example symbol):

<pre>(∇:): monad
(∇): dyad</pre>
