'''Each''', also known as '''map''', is used to apply a function to all elements of an array <code>y</code>.

When given two arguments and dyadic <code>f</code>, acts as a '''zip''' or '''each dyad''' adverb, applying <code>f</code> between each element of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. The two arrays must be equal in length.

If <code>x</code> is an atom, it will be repeated for each element in <code>y</code>.

<pre>
 {2*x}'5 7 2
10 14 4

 1 2 3{x,y}'3 4 5
(1 3
 2 4
 3 5)

 (5),'1 3 4
(5 1
 5 3
 5 4)
</pre>

Each also generalizes to multiple arguments and n-adic functions:

<pre>
 {x+y-z}'[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9]
-2 -1 0
