{{primitive|<x}}
The '''grade up''' primitive is used to get the indices of an array that would sort it in ascending order.

Since grading is not the same as sorting, a general idiom used to sort arrays is <code>{x(<x)}</code> or other equivalent.

Grade primitives generally use a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stable_sorts stable sort], which means that an ascending grade may not always be the inverse of a descending grade.

For numeric arrays:
<pre>
 <34 -1 0 67 32767
1 2 0 3 4</pre>

Grading of string arrays largely depends upon the implementation.

For ngn/k(K6), groups by type and sorts each individual group:
<pre>
 {x(<x)}("xyz";"a";"k";"j";"apl";"bqn")
("apl"
 "bqn"
 "xyz"
 "a"
 "j"
 "k")
</pre>
