{{primitive|>x}}
The '''grade down''' primitive is used to get the indices of an array that would sort it in descending order.

Since grading is not the same as sorting, a general idiom used to sort arrays is <code>{x(>x)}</code> or other equivalent.

Grade primitives generally use a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stable_sorts stable sort], which means that an descending grade may not always be the inverse of an ascending grade.

For numeric arrays:
<pre>
 >34 -1 0 67 32767
4 3 0 2 1
</pre>

Grading of string arrays largely depends upon the implementation, as shown in [[grade up]].
