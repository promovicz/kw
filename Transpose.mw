'''Transpose''' (a.k.a. '''flip''') swaps the leading two axes of a 2+ dimensional rectangular array. Dialects differ in their treatment of atoms, lists, and ragged arrays.

  +("ab";"cd";"ef")
 ("ace"
  "bdf")
 
  +(`a`b`c;`d)
 (`a`d
  `b`d
  `c`d)

== Atoms and lists ==

Transposing a list in oK or ngn/k [[enlist]]s it. Transposing an atom enlists twice:

  +,0
 ,,0
  +0
 ,,0

K4 and Kona return the argument as-is.

K9 throws a rank error.
