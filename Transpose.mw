'''Transpose''', a.k.a. '''flip''', swaps the two leading axes of a 2+ dimensional rectangular array. Dialects differ in their treatment of atoms, lists, and ragged arrays.
  +("ab";"cd";"ef")
 ("ace"
  "bdf")
Atoms in otherwise rectangular arrays are extended to the full length of the corresponding dimension:
  +(`a`b`c;`d)
 (`a`d
  `b`d
  `c`d)
==Atoms and lists==
Transposing a list in oK or ngn/k [[enlist]]s it. Transposing an atom enlists twice<ref>https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok/issues/77</ref>:
  +,0
 ,,0
  +0
 ,,0
K3, K4, and Kona<ref>https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona/issues/527</ref> return the argument as-is.

K9 throws a rank error.
==Ragged arrays==
oK and ngn/k reshape shorter rows to the length of the longest row:
  +(`a`b`c;`d`e)
 (`a`d
  `b`e
  `c`d)
K9 pads shorter rows with nulls:
  +(`a`b`c;`d`e)
 (`a`d
  `b`e
  `c`)
