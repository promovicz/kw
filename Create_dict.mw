{{primitive|x!y}}

The '''create dict''' primitive, a.k.a. '''map''', takes two lists of equal length and makes a [[dictionary]] using the left argument as keys, and the right argument as the values.

<pre>
  `a`b!3 4
[a:3;b:4]
  4 5!6 7
4 5!6 7
</pre>

In k7, k9, and ngn/k, if <code>y</code> is an atom, it's extended to the length of <code>x</code>.
  `a`b!2
 `a`b!2 2
