{{primitive|.x<br>x!y}}

The '''create dict''' primitive, a.k.a. '''map''' converts its argument(s) to a dictionary.

==== K3 ====
Takes a an array of pairs and converts it to a dictionary.
<pre>
 .((`a;10);(`b;20))  
.((`a;10;)
  (`b;20;))
</pre>
{{works in|Kona}}

==== K6+ ====

Takes two lists of equal length and makes a [[dictionary]] using the left argument as keys, and the right argument as the values.
Uniqueness of the keys is not enforced.

<pre>
  `a`b!3 4
[a:3;b:4]
  4 5!6 7
4 5!6 7
</pre>

In k7, k9, and ngn/k, if <code>y</code> is an atom, it's extended to the length of <code>x</code>.
  `a`b!2
 `a`b!2 2
