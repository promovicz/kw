{{primitive|x#y}}

The '''reshape''' primitive takes the elements of an array <code>y</code>, and fits them in a rectangular nested array shape given by <code>x</code>.

The array elements are repeated to fit the shape given in <code>x</code>, if the product of x is greater than the length of y.

K6 and its successors allow [[null?|<code>0N</code>]] as one of the dimensions to allow omitting one dimension.

Effectively, it means "maximize this dimension with respect to the other dimension and the size of the array."

This can result in non-rectangular arrays, since it splits the array <code>y</code> to fit the constraints in <code>x</code>.
