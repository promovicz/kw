Welcome to the K wiki. 

Contributing is simple.
* If the page you are trying to make has an existing template, use it and extend upon it.
* References are ''very'' important when making an information based contribution.
* Keep external links in References, unless the page warrants it (i.e. [[Learning Resources]]).
* K has many dialects, extensions and implementations. If you are talking about an implementation specific detail, make sure that you also refer to whcih implementation you are talking about, generally by creating a section.
* If you are adding to a page, please give a short(few words) description of your edit, even if it is small and trivial.
