Welcome to the K wiki. 

Contributing is simple.
* If the page you are trying to make has an existing template, use it and extend upon it. This page lists all templates: [https://k.miraheze.org/wiki/Special:AllPages?from=&to=&namespace=10 link]
* References are ''very'' important when making an information related contribution.
* Keep external links in References, unless the page warrants it (i.e. [[Learning Resources]]).
* K has many dialects, extensions and implementations. If you are talking about an implementation specific detail, make sure that you also refer to whcih implementation you are talking about, generally by creating a section.
* If you are adding to a page, please give a short(few words) description of your edit, even if it is small and trivial.

If you'd like a good place to start, do check out the [[Special:WantedPages|Wanted Pages]] section. You can ignore all pages starting with <code>Template</code> and <code>Module</code>, or any site related namespace.
